==============================

[![STDM Screenshot](/images/readme/image1.png)](http://stdm.gltn.net/)

The Social Tenure Domain Model (STDM) is a propoor land information tool that provides a flexible approach for representing people-land relationships. The tool provides a practical approach for representing these relationships independent of the level of formality, legality and technical accuracy.

Some of the functionality provided by the tool include:

-   It enables the design of new or extension of existing data configurations using an intuitive configuration wizard;

-   It allows for the definition of custom, application-wide, hierarchies of administrative units;

-   It supports the design of custom templates for map-based documents/reports;

-   It enables the generation of map-based documents in batch using custom templates;

-   It provides intuitive import and export wizards that support both textual and spatial data in different formats.
